# SMART-NON-INVASIVE-GLUCOSE-MONITORING-USING-NIR-AND-AI-INTEGRATION
A non-invasive, AI-powered glucose monitoring system utilizes NIR spectroscopy and physiological signals to estimate glucose levels and detect stress. By analyzing the correlation between stress and glucose variation, it integrates machine learning and IoT for real-time tracking and intelligent diabetes management.
